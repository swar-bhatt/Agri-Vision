## Dataset Information
The datasets used for training the Growth Stage Prediction and Crop Disease Classification models were sourced from Roboflow.

### Growth Stage Prediction Dataset -
https://universe.roboflow.com/p-project-ebvkg/cotton-boll-growth-detection/dataset/5
*The above dataset is also having appropriate labels for YOLO model training

### Crop Disease Classification Dataset -

---

## 🧪 Running Unit Tests & Coverage

Agri-Vision includes a comprehensive unit and integration testing suite built using `pytest` and `pytest-cov`. 

The test suite runs programmatically in-memory, requiring no external files or slow deep learning model loading. This ensures tests run in **less than 1 second** with **89%+ code coverage**.

### 1️⃣ Run Unit Tests & Coverage (Simultaneously)

Thanks to the pre-configured [pytest.ini](file:///d:/GITHUB%20LOCAL/Agri-Vision/pytest.ini), you don't need to pass long command line arguments. Running a single command will execute all 28 tests, generate verbose progress, check code coverage, and produce an HTML report automatically:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

**Expected Output:**
```text
tests/test_app.py::test_preprocess_image_for_resnet PASSED               [  3%]
tests/test_app.py::test_infer_disease_fallback PASSED                    [  7%]
...
tests/test_app.py::test_post_api_analyze_exception PASSED                [100%]

=============================== tests coverage ================================
Name     Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
--------------------------------------
app.py     201     22    89%   81-83, 88-90, 159, 406-420
--------------------------------------
TOTAL      201     22    89%

Coverage HTML written to dir htmlcov
============================= 28 passed in 1.06s ==============================
```

### 2️⃣ View Interactive HTML Coverage Report

When you run the tests, a beautiful interactive HTML coverage report is automatically created in the `htmlcov/` directory.

To visually inspect which lines are covered (in green) and which are missed (in red) line-by-line:
1. Open the folder `htmlcov/` in your file explorer.
2. Double-click `index.html` to open it in any web browser.
3. Click on `app.py` to view the beautiful interactive code visualization.

### 3️⃣ Automated Continuous Integration (CI)

A GitHub Actions workflow is fully set up in [.github/workflows/tests.yml](file:///d:/GITHUB%20LOCAL/Agri-Vision/.github/workflows/tests.yml). It will automatically run your entire unit test suite and verify code quality/coverage metrics on every single `push` or `pull_request` to the `main` branch.
